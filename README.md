### Upwork

For my university project, I scraped the Upwork website. The notebook file with the script can be found [here](https://github.com/abdu95/ds3_assignment_NLP/blob/main/upwork-scrape.ipynb). 

Upwork is an American freelancing platform where freelancers and clients connect in order to conduct business. In Upwork Community forum, people publish their questions in the form of posts. There are separate pages for different members: freelancers, clients, agencies, first-timers.

Each post has title & content. I scraped these Upwork forum posts and and planned to label each post with topics using **topic modeling**. I also made a **sentiment analysis** using this data.
